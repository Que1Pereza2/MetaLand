    This repository is an exercise used to learn Bootstrap, in this exercise we 
need to create a static website that employs 3 different web static pages.
    The website should be responsive, meaning that it should adapt to the screen
size of the device it's being used on.
    It's up to the student to decide on the theme of the website,but the website
should at least have the following:
    - A navigation bar (that is present on all pages):
        ○ 2 links. ✅
        ○ Image as a logo. ✅
        ○ Search bar. ✅
    - Buttons. ✅
    - DropDowns. ✅
    - Forms. ✅
    - A responsive table. ✅
